              <p>“Self is control of myself, but also control from others. I was controlled as a Navajo slave in a Navajo boarding school and institutionalized. I was taken away from my brother and family. I’ve been controlled most of my life. I was in the Army too, they were nothing but controlling. Being in jail was the most controlled I’ve ever been in my life.
          I’m 40 years old now. I’ve learned to let go of all pain, all suffering, to let go of the past. Forgive. Be kind to self. And things come back to the middle. Always be kind and humble, and things start to make sense.
          How much control I have now? I’m free as a bird, free to be as native as I can be. Being free and uncontrolled is life. And always walk in beauty! Peace to you my brother.” </br> -Leaf-In-The-Wind

              <li ><p><span>Analysis: </br>Interestingly, the outlook on the self as described by our talk with Leaf-in-the-Wind takes on aspects of both free will and destiny. As a free man now, he feels as if he has never had more control over his life. However, the early years of his life were much different and the effects of being institutionalized had an impact on his own self.
          The effects of being institutionalized have been widely examined, particularly regarding negative impacts it can often have on people regarding their sense of self worth and dependence on institutional structures to function properly. A report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services studied the effects of being institutionalized and found that many of those incarcerated suffered psychological effects. Many of those incarcerated often lose their own self-initiative and independence to make choices in their life. Interpersonal mistrust with others can grow and self-imposed isolation can occur. Often times prisoners may lose their self-worth and think of themselves how they were internalized, as “the kind of person who deserves only the degradation and stigma to which they have been subjected while incarcerated.”
          While some may be destined to be trapped within the system for the remainder of their lives, others do make it out of institutions and some like Leaf-in-the-Wind find better days where they feel as if they are in total control. Our discussion with Leaf displayed both sides of the story; often times we may be controlled or destined to become a certain person, but other times we break out of the determined path and pave a new one for ourselves.
