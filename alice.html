          I don’t know, I wish I could tell you the answer. To me, I feel like I have some control over the little daily things in life. But do I have control over where I’m headed? Does everyone have control over their lives? I wonder about it sometimes, but I have this overwhelming feeling that we don’t have as much control as we might think. The universe works in mysterious ways, and I don’t think we will ever fully understand who we are completely or the extent to how much we can change things. I hope that helps.” </br> -"Alice"

              <li ><p><span>Analysis: </br>After talking with our friend Alice, her view of the self seems to lie more on the destiny (or determinism) end of the free will spectrum. She mentioned she wouldn’t be who she was today without everyone else in her life, leading us toward the idea that everything we do and know and resemble has been influenced with everything around us. While the perception of free will may be there, it may be an illusion to us and we may be predetermined to carry out all the actions in our life. 
  While it may seem implausible, the possibility of it being true is there. The existence of determinism is not impossible and some research has left it open to interpretation. In 2002, experiments at Oxford University were conducted to determine the timing of conscious willings or decisions of individuals when faced with some kind of outside influence. Primary contributor Benjamin Libet argued that there was clear evidence that our own actions are already beginning before the agent wills it so. If we have some evidence that our actions are beginning before our minds will them to do it, is this proof that everything we do is predetermined? It is possible, though the study also discusses our ability to veto actions that arise out of the unconscious mind. In fact, it is even possible that what really exists is a form of compatibilism, a mixture of determinism and free will. However, as intriguing as this dilemma is, it is very likely we’ll never know the true answer to this. 
  Alice may be right, and we may all be floating along in the cosmic predetermined existence that we think we know and our perceptions of free will may be entirely made of illusion. Though it is also entirely possible that we are living in a deterministic reality that is so complex and intertwined, it is simply impossible to understand the gravity of it all.
