              <p>“The self is outwardly how we treat not only others but our self as well! I don’t really believe in any sort of destiny, I guess. I think all of our actions have consequences whether good or bad, but one thing is for sure in my mind and it’s that we have some sense of control.
          If my mind made a decision- i.e., negatively, then my mind always has the ability to change back to the positive! I think a lot of people struggle with the idea that they have the power to change their life and I hear a lot of reasons to why such and such never happened. I’ve heard about things like the THIQ gene that makes a person predisposed to alcoholism. That’s what my husband has told me. I struggled with my own drug for a long time too. But I look back and I think I allowed it to control me, and that’s the problem in my mind.” </br> -Cheryl

              <li ><p><span>Analysis: </br>A very friendly woman named Cheryl shared her feelings toward what the self is and how much control it has, and she largely believes that free will is present in all our lives though we might not realize the extent to which we have it. She mentioned problems that her husband had with alcoholism and that he often placed the blame on genetic predispositions of chemical imbalances. Cheryl too admitted that she had struggled with addiction, though having been clean for a long time she explained her perspective had shifted and that she was in control the whole time whether or not she realized it. 
  The National Institutes of Health have examined the problems of addiction and the impact it has on people’s perceptions of their own free will. Their findings revealed that changing conditions to increase free will beliefs did not stray from those with the control conditions, leading researchers to believe that most people seem to believe in free will. In recent years, they argue that people claim to have lower levels of responsibility for their actions and the consequences of them. Often times they place the blame instead on things such as the unconscious, genetics, social factors, societal oppression, stress, substances, and many others.   There may be something to this, the idea that we really do possess free will but it is often overshadowed by our misconceptions of the world directly around us. In Cheryl’s mind, however, it’s important to remind yourself that you are the one in control even if it may not be what it appears, and it’s important to bring positivity with it.
